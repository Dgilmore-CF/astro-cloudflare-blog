# Cloudflare Configuration Example
# Copy this file to .env for local development (optional)
# Most configuration is in wrangler.toml

# These are handled by wrangler.toml bindings, shown here for reference
# DB - Cloudflare D1 Database binding
# IMAGES - Cloudflare R2 Bucket binding

# Optional: Environment identifier
ENVIRONMENT=development

# Note: For production, set these in Cloudflare Dashboard under Pages settings
# You don't need a .env file for the blog to work - wrangler handles bindings automatically
